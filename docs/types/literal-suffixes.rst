Literal Suffixes
================

While Solidity :ref:`provides implicit conversions<types-conversion-literals>` from its literals to selected types,
there are types for which no built-in conversions are available (most notably the
:ref:`user-defined value types<user-defined-value-types>`).

To fill this gap, it is possible to define custom conversions as *literal suffixes*.

    function add(Coin a, Coin b) pure returns (Coin) {

    function eq(Coin a, Coin b) pure returns (bool) {

Defining Suffix Functions
-------------------------

Literal suffixes can be defined by applying the built-in ``suffix`` modifier to a :ref:`free function<functions>`.

Only pure functions can be used as suffixes.
This means that suffixes cannot read or modify blockchain state.
As with all pure functions, however, they can perform pure external calls.

.. index:: literal;address

Suffix Function Parameters
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A suffix function must accept and return exactly one value.
As a special case, suffixes on :ref:`rational literals<rational_literals>` can optionally accept two arguments,
produced by the :ref:`fractional decomposition<fractional_decomposition>` of such a literal.

Suffixes can only have parameters of types for which an implicit conversion from a literal exists.
For single-parameter suffixes, this includes the following types:

+-------------------------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------+

+-------------------------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------+

For two-parameter suffix functions, the first parameter (representing the mantissa) can be of any integer type.
The second parameter (the exponent) must be of an unsigned integer type.

.. note::
    40-digit literals prefixed with ``0x`` such as, for example, ``0xdCad3a6d3569DF655070DEd06cb7A1b2Ccd1D3AF``
    always represent ``address`` literals in the language.
    To invoke a suffix accepting ``bytes20`` you must use one of the other literal kinds implicitly
    convertible to ``bytes20``, e.g., a hexadecimal string literal
    (``hex"dCad3a6d3569DF655070DEd06cb7A1b2Ccd1D3AF"``).

.. note::
    Suffix functions accepting ``address payable`` are not allowed since address literals are never payable.

Suffix functions may not accept or return reference types with ``storage`` or ``calldata`` locations.

.. index:: function;call
.. _calling_suffix_functions:

Calling Suffix Functions
------------------------

There are two ways to call a suffix function:

#. Suffix call.
#. Function call.

.. index:: ! literal suffix; suffix call syntax

Suffix Call Syntax
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A suffix call has the same syntax as a literal with a :ref:`denomination<denominations>`:

.. code-block:: solidity

    42 suffix;
    1.23 suffix;
    0x1234 suffix;
    'abc' suffix;
    hex"12ff" suffix;
    unicode"ðŸ˜ƒ" suffix;
    true suffix;

The literal passed as input to the suffix function must be immediately followed by the name of the suffix.
The two must be separated by whitespace unless it's a string, unicode or hexadecimal string literal,
in which case the whitespace is optional (i.e. ``'abc'suffix`` is also valid).

This call syntax supports only a single literal argument.
Variables or expressions (even as simple as wrapping the literal in parentheses) are not allowed.
Suffix functions defined with two parameters are also invoked with one literal - the
:ref:`decomposition<fractional_decomposition>` of the literal into two values is performed implicitly
by the compiler.

.. note::
    There are no negative number literals in Solidity.
    A literal with a minus sign is an expression.
    ``-123 suffix`` is equivalent to ``-(123 suffix)``, so ``suffix`` does not receive ``-123`` as input.
    The argument is instead ``123``, and the negation is applied to the returned value.

.. note::
    String concatenation produces a single literal at compilation time and therefore is not treated
    as an expression.
    This means that e.g., ``"abc" "def" suffix`` is a valid suffix call.

.. index:: ! literal suffix; function call syntax, overload

Function Call Syntax
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Suffix definitions are in all respects valid free functions, and this includes the ability to call
them directly.
This makes it possible to call such functions with arguments which are not literals.

.. code-block:: solidity

    suffix(42);
    suffix(123, 2);
    suffix(0x1234);
    suffix('abc');
    suffix(hex"12ff");
    suffix(unicode"ðŸ˜ƒ");
    suffix(true);

Note that the fractional decomposition is not performed for this kind of call - two-argument
suffix functions must be explicitly called with two arguments.

Regardless of the call syntax used and in contrast to applying a denomination, the result of the
call is itself not considered a literal.
As a consequence, it cannot be used as input of another suffix call, and calculations on it are performed
within its type rather than in arbitrary precision (as is the case with calculations on rational number
literals).

.. note::
    Function call syntax is the only way to pass a negative integer value into a suffix function
    that has a parameter of a signed integer type.

.. note::
    As all free functions, suffix definitions can be :ref:`overloaded<overload-function>`.
    Overloaded suffixes, however, cannot be invoked using the suffix call syntax.

.. index:: ! fractional decomposition
.. _fractional_decomposition:

Fractional Decomposition
------------------------

To allow defining suffixes that work with fractional literals, like ``1.23``, the language allows
a special form of a suffix definition.
Such a suffix can be considered a more general form of a suffix taking a single integer argument.

A single-parameter suffix can be applied only to those rational number literals which represent
integers.
Let us consider the following suffix definition:

.. code-block:: solidity

    function kg(uint grams) pure suffix returns (uint) {
        return 1000 * grams;
    }

The ``kg`` suffix can receive integer values like ``123 kg``, ``1.23e2 kg``, or ``12300e-2 kg``.
However, invoking such a suffix with a fractional number (e.g., ``1.23 kg``) triggers an error.
We can fix that by adding an *exponent* parameter:

.. code-block:: solidity

    function kg(uint mantissa, uint exponent) pure suffix returns (uint) {
        return 1000 * mantissa / 10**exponent;
    }

When defined this way, the suffix can handle all the literals it could previously, while ``1.23 kg``
also becomes a valid expression, equivalent to ``kg(123, 2)``.

More generally, the argument of such a suffix call is decomposed into two integer values (``mantissa``
and ``exponent``), such that:

#. ``mantissa * 10**-exponent`` is equal to the value of the literal.
#. ``exponent`` is the smallest possible non-negative integer value satisfying the equation.

The two rules provide unambiguous decomposition in all cases.
For example:

- ``123000`` is decomposed into ``123000 * 10**-0`` (i.e. ``123000`` for ``mantissa`` and ``0`` for ``exponent``).
  Not ``123 * 10**3`` or ``123000000 * 10**-3``.

  In general, when the suffix is invoked on an integer, ``mantissa`` is always equal to that integer
  and ``exponent`` is ``0``.
- ``1.23`` is decomposed into ``123 * 10**-2``, not ``1.23 * 10**-0`` or ``123000 * 10**-5``.

  In general, when the suffix is invoked on a fractional number, ``exponent`` is the negation of
  the lowest negative power of ``10`` that, when multiplied by the literal, produces an integer value.
  ``mantissa`` is the result of that multiplication.

``exponent`` is never negative and therefore must have an unsigned integer type.
